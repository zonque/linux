PXA3xx's pinmux nodes act as a container for an abitrary number of subnodes.
Each of these subnodes represents muxing for a pin, a group, or a list of
pins or groups.

The name of each subnode is not important; all subnodes should be enumerated
and processed purely based on their content.

Required subnode-properties:
- marvell,pins	: An array of strings. Each string contains the name of a pin
		  or group.
- marvell,function	: A string containing the name of the function to mux to the
		  pin or group.
- marvell,drive-strength : An integer value that means the drive strength of a
                        pin.
- marvell,pull-up	: The property means a pin is pull up for input.
- marvell,pull-down : The property means a pin is pull down for input.
- marvell,lowpower-pull-up : The property means a pin is pull up for input in
			  sleep state.
- marvell,lowpower-pull-down : The property means a pin is pull down for input
			    in sleep state.
- marvell,lowpower-drive-high : The property means a pin is driving high for
			     output in sleep state.
- marvell,lowpower-drive-low : The property means a pin is driving low for
			    output in sleep state.
- marvell,lowpower-float : The property means a pin is float in sleep state.
- marvell,lowpower-zero : The property means a pin is not configured in sleep
			state.
